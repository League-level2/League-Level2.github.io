<h1>Drawing Shapes</h1>
<h2>paintComponent()</h2>
 
<br>                    
<p class="normal">
1. Before you can complete this section, you must first have created a <code>GamePanel</code> class.<br>
<br>
2. The <code>GamePanel</code> class needs to override the <code>JPanel paintComponent()</code> method. To do this, copy the method below <b>exactly as written</b> and put it into the <code>GamePanel</code> class.<br>
    </p>
<pre>@Override

public void paintComponent(Graphics g){

}</pre> <br><p class="normal">Make sure the <code>java.awt.Graphics</code> class has been imported into <code>GamePanel</code>.<br><br>
      
3. We will use the paintComponent parameter, a Graphics object called g, to draw our game onto the GamePanel. First draw a rectangle using the following code:<br>

<pre>g.fillRect(10, 10, 100, 100);</pre>
<br>
<p class="normal">The parameters for the rectangle are the exact same as Processing: (x, y, width, height). So this code will draw a square that is located at (x,y) = (10,10) and whose sides are 100 pixels long.<br>
<br>

4. In the <code>actionPerformed()</code> method delete your syso command. Call <code>repaint()</code>; This will redraw the panel.
<br><br>

5. Run the program. Do you see a square appear in your window? Do not continue until you do. Ask your teacher for help if needed.
