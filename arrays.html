<h1>Arrays</h1>

<p class="normal">
Variables are used to hold a single value. For example:<br>
    
  </p>
<p class="code">
int age = 12; <br>
String name = “Sarah”;
</p>

    <p class="normal">
    However, what if a program needed a list of names? We don't want to declare multiple variables with meaningless names like name1, name2, name3, etc.<br><br>
Arrays allow us to store multiple values of the same type. Just put brackets [] after the type and before the name.<br> E.g. <br>
</p>
    <p class="code">

	String[] names = {"Sarah", "Joe","Ali", "Jose"};<br>
        int[] ages = {12, 15, 9, 5};<br><br>
    </p>
    <p class="normal">
    If we don't know the values, but we know that we are going to have 4 of them in our array, we can declare the array as follows:<br>
        
    </p>
    <p class="code">
	String[] moreNames = new String[4];<br>
        int[] moreAges = new int[4];
</p>

    <p class="normal">
    Unfortunately, we need to know exactly how many elements we are going to get before we can initialize the array because its length cannot change once it is set.
 <br><br> 
    
        We access the elements of an array by using an index in brackets []. The indexes start at 0.<br>
        NOTE: The highest posssible index is the length of the array - 1.<br><br>
    In the case of the names array above, we could use the index to print each name as follows:<br></p>

    <p class="code">

	System.out.println(name[0]);<br>
	System.out.println(name[1]);<br>
	System.out.println(name[2]);<br>
	System.out.println(name[3]);<br>
        
    </p>       
        
      <p class="normal">
          ..but imagine how many lines of code you would need for 100 names...<br><br>
          So, in order to process each element in an array, we should use a for loop, and use the length of the array to supply the end point, like this:<br></p>
     <p class="code">

	for (int i=0;i&lt;names.length;i++) {<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println(name[i]);<br>
	}<br>
        
    </p>
        <p class="normal">
          Another type of for loop is available for processing all the elements of an array.<br> It is called a "for each" loop and the syntax looks like this:<br></p>
     <p class="code">

	for (String name : names) {<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println(name);<br>
	}<br>
    	for (int age : ages) {<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println(age);<br>
	}<br>    
    </p>   
    <p class="normal">Each time the loop repeats, the variable (name or age) gets a new value from the next element of the array.<br>
    The loop will repeat until there are no more elements in the array.</p>
